# utilities
In this repository I have different codes which are not post processing tools but created or adapted codes for many different tasks.

The automatic generator of inputs for dftb is a tool to be included soon in stk with the main objective of speed-up high-thruoughput calculations especially for periodic systems like molecular crystals or polymers.

Dendrytes and PCC_SAW codes are used to generate the coordinates of dendrytes and random chains of polymers for further 
calculations like in the GA case. 

The ising.py is a code to generate the best configuration based on the free energy and could be further used for polymeric blends and simulation of mobility.

The gfnxtb_input.py is a code perform calculations with the semiempirical method GFN-XTB in cluster with pbs configurations. This is with the aim of studying systems of polymers with exotic atoms like Ge, Se and As which are not parametrized in DFTB+.
